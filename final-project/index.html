				<h2>The costume designer and two-time Oscar winner has propelled Afrofuturism into the fashion mainstream with her work on “Black Panther” and “Wakanda Forever.”</h2>
				<p><i>This story has been reproduced as part of coursework for the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland.

			<p>A costume designer is, first and foremost, a storyteller,” said Ruth E. Carter.</p>
			<p>Carter, 63, was the first Black person to win an Oscar in the costuming category, for the 2018 film “Black Panther.” When she took home her second Academy Award in March, for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” she also became the first person to win for both an original movie and its sequel.</p>
			<p>Wakanda, the world of the “Black Panther” films, is a fictional African kingdom, reimagined without the footprint of colonization. Carter borrowed from Indigenous cultures across the continent for her designs: Buyers during pre-production sourced tribal artifacts including Dogon masks from Mali, Himba crowns from Namibia, Maasai beading from Kenya and stacked neck rings worn by Ndebele women from South Africa. Carter also drew inspiration from contemporary African fashion designers such as Laduma Ngxokolo, the founder of the South African knitwear brand MaXhosa Africa, and the Ghanaian British tailor Ozwald Boateng, and scouted streetwear at the Afropunk music festival in Johannesburg to see new trends firsthand.</p>
			<p>“There is not and never was a singular African aesthetic,” Carter said.</p>
			<p>For the designer, trailblazing has become something of a habit: Through her work over the last three decades on films including “Malcolm X,” “Amistad” and Marvel blockbusters, she has definitively shaped how stories of Black history and culture are represented on the big screen.</p>
			<p>Among the sources of inspiration Carter cites are the artist Romare Bearden, whose collages (top) influenced her work on Spike Lee’s films, and the Afropunk Festival (bottom), which contributed to her vision for the “Black Panther” films.</p>
			<p>“When you’re representing cultures and representing yourself — it’s never a burden, it’s a joy — but the pressure to get it right is like a calling,” Carter said recently from her home in Los Angeles.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Carter, who grew up in Massachusetts, the youngest of eight children raised by a single mother, took her first sewing class at her local Boys and Girls Club. After graduating from Hampton University, a historically Black college in Virginia, she worked in theater and opera before moving in 1986 to Los Angeles, where she met the director Spike Lee; her first movie, one of many collaborations with Lee, was 1988’s “School Daze.”</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Even when she’s not outfitting Afrofuturist realms, Carter is always looking to Africa and its diaspora for inspiration. For period pieces, she turns to “The Image of the Black in Western Art,” a 10-book series that features thousands of images of people of African descent from across four millenniums. For many of her collaborations with Lee, such as “Do the Right Thing” and “Jungle Fever,” she looked to the artist Romare Bearden, known for his collage scenes of city life and the American South. And for “Mo’ Better Blues,” Carter focused on the personal style of jazz musicians such as Dexter Gordon, Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>“It is always important to me to be inspired by something or someone real,” she said. “I search for tiny human details that I can uncover and then apply to my characters.”</p>
			<p>Carter’s designs don’t just bring the Black diaspora together: Her work, particularly on “Black Panther,” has helped propel Afrofuturism into the fashion mainstream, inspiring Serena Williams’s French Open catsuit, fan merch and presentations at New York Fashion Week.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>“We honor the culture, but we also move it forward,” said Carter.</p>

				<h2>With over a billion streams, the Nigerian native’s Afrobeats music is helping reshape global narratives about Africa.</h2>
				<p><i>This story has been reproduced as part of coursework for the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. It was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/16/world/africa/african-artists-ruth-carter-mr-eazi.html">originally published on The New York Times</a>.</i></p>

			<p>“Where is home?” is not a simple question for the Nigerian musician Mr Eazi.</p>
			<p>“The plane,” he said, joking, on a video call from New York. Then, more seriously: “I think home is anywhere I have family, so that switches between Accra, London, Cotonou, Lagos and Dubai.”</p>
			<p>Mr Eazi, 32, was born Oluwatosin Oluwole Ajibade in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. But his life and career have been marked by a connection to the world outside his native country. The first time Mr Eazi entered a recording studio, he was studying mechanical engineering at a university in Kumasi, Ghana. (It was there that he got the name Mr Eazi: He’d reportedly break up fights, saying, “Take it easy, take it easy.”) He performed in Brooklyn in 2016 — invited by the rapper Lauryn Hill — before, he said, he had ever done a show in Nigeria. And he was featured on the 2019 “Lion King” soundtrack and has appeared on songs with the Colombian singer J Balvin, the Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny and the Jamaican artist Popcaan, as well as Nicki Minaj and Diplo.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mr Eazi gained popularity in the mid-to-late 2010s with catchy Afrobeats songs such as “Skin Tight” and “Leg Over.” He described the sound of those early songs as Banku, a melting pot of Ghanaian highlife music with Nigerian chord progressions.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>His initial success came at a time when Nigerian artists like WizKid were breaking through to Western audiences due, in part, to social media, cosigns by international artists — and the diaspora.</p>
			<p></p>
            <br>
            <br>

            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
			<p>His sound was distinctive among his peers. “Many of the most popular Afrobeats artists — such as Wizkid, Davido, and Patoranking — wield an upbeat vocal tempo,” Lawrence Burney wrote for Vice in 2016. Mr Eazi, in contrast, used his “deep hum of a voice to give ballad-like qualities to dance-forward production.”</p>
			<p>Africans in Britain were instrumental to Mr Eazi’s early success. “For me, outside of Ghana, the next place that embraced my music was the U.K.,” he said. Young Black students were the first to gravitate toward his music, inviting him to perform for their African Caribbean Societies — campus associations that play a large role in the lives of many Black people studying at British universities. “These were the ones defining what it is to be cool and embracing their Africanness,” he said. “That was the foundation of the African diaspora pushing the music.”</p>
			<p>For his newest album, “The Evil Genius,” Mr Eazi commissioned original pieces by African artists that correspond with each track. Sesse Elangwe, a Cameroonian artist based in Texas, created “The Way I See It” as an interpretation of the song “Chop Time, No Friend.”</p>
			<p>While Mr Eazi has been releasing singles, collaborations and mixtapes — with well over a billion streams online — it wasn’t until October of this year that he released what he called his debut studio album, “The Evil Genius.” Recorded in Britain, the United States and various African countries, the songs trace a narrative of loneliness, romance and community. Mr Eazi commissioned pieces to visually represent each track from 13 African artists, which were exhibited at shows in Britain and Ghana.</p>
			<p>“People are discovering Africa first, not through the lens of CNN or The New York Times,” he said, but rather “through the lens of the music.”</p>

				<h2>History, inheritance and possibility are re-imagined through the lens of the Senegalese photographer, one of the most successful young artists on the continent.</h2>
				<p><i>This story has been reproduced as part of coursework for the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. It was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/16/world/africa/african-artists-ruth-carter-mr-eazi.html">originally published on The New York Times</a>.</i></p>

			<p>In one of his famed self-portraits, Omar Victor Diop, a Senegalese photographer and artist, wears a three-piece suit and an extravagant paisley bow tie, preparing to blow a yellow, plastic whistle. The elaborately staged photograph evokes the memory of Frederick Douglass, the one-time fugitive slave who in the 19th century rose to become a leading abolitionist, activist, writer and orator, as well as the first African American to be nominated for vice president of the United States.</p>
			<p>Diop is no stranger to portraying the aches and hopes of Black people across the world. Throughout his oeuvre, which incorporates historical references and costumes, he has highlighted the vital role of Black and African figures in world history, celebrated the dignity of African migrants and refugees, weaved together the history of Black protests from the Selma march to the Soweto uprising in South Africa, and examined the impact of climate change on Africa and the Global South.</p>
			<p>Through his bold images, Diop examines the interplay between African and diasporic experiences by knitting together the past and present.</p>
			<p>“I am fascinated and surprised about how Africa is still present in everything an African American would do; they don’t even realize it,” said Diop, who lives and works in Dakar and Paris. “Sometimes you look at an African American in reality TV and you happen to be looking at your sisters and your aunts because of the expressions — it’s translated and said in English, but she could be in Dakar, speaking Wolof.”</p>
			<p>In a 2015 self-portrait (top), from Diop’s series “Project Diaspora,” the artist emulates Frederick Douglass, who was the most photographed man of his era. Douglass sat for over 160 portraits, including a daguerreotype circa 1855 (bottom), to challenge negative representations of African Americans.</p>
			<p>Diop is interested in creating connection and community through his work, while also using history to bridge the experiences of people of African descent. By highlighting figures like Douglass or events such as the Women’s War in Nigeria, he said, he hoped to not only kickstart a conversation within the upcoming generation but also deepen the relationship between Africa and the diaspora.</p>
			<p>“There are so many inspiring stories that can have significant resonance on the continent and vice versa,” he said. “I think that there is an absolute need for more interaction. We don't even know each other enough.”</p>
			<p>Diop was born in Dakar in 1980 to a father who is a chartered accountant and a mother who is a lawyer. He became a full-time artist over a decade ago, after years of studying finance in Senegal and France and working in corporate communications in Dakar, Nairobi and Lagos.</p>
			<p>The self-taught Diop, whose tableaux have been exhibited all over the world, builds on the rich tradition of the West African studio portraiture practiced by artists like Mama Casset (Senegal), Malick Sidibé (Mali) and Samuel Fosso (Nigeria). But his work is not bound by the traditions of studio photography: As he embarks on a project, Diop obsessively reads about his subjects, talks to historians and even tries to replicate his subjects’ sartorial choices, such as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s suits or Trayvon Martin’s hooded sweatshirt.</p>
			<p>“The imagery of fashion, the language of fashion is a tool for me to enter the minds” of viewers, he said. “It's creating an image that is very attractive as a way to camouflage the heavy subjects that I am bringing. And it is also a way for me to celebrate the memory that I am bringing.”</p>
			<p>In early October, Diop announced a new project called “Being There,” which explores the place of race and identity in America in the years following World War II.</p>
			<p>Diop is also planning on producing educational materials, including books and games, that will engage young African and diasporic audiences on issues like art and climate change. He hopes to show how their stories of struggle and success are interconnected across centuries and continents.</p>
			<p>“I am a firm believer that there is an African spirit of resilience, of excellence despite everything that has been thrown at us,” he said.</p>

				<h2>Twenty years ago, American publishers thought the work of the sci-fi novelist was unrelatable. This year, she signed a seven-figure deal for her next book.</h2>
				<p><i>This story has been reproduced as part of coursework for the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. It was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/16/world/africa/african-artists-ruth-carter-mr-eazi.html">originally published on The New York Times</a>.</i></p>

		<div class="col">
			<p>When Nnedi Okorafor signed a seven-figure deal earlier this year for her newest novel, “The Africanfuturist,” it was the achievement of a dream three decades in the making.</p>
			<p>The book, scheduled to publish in 2025, is the kind of story Okorafor, 49, has always wanted to write, and one she said she never would have been able to sell when she was starting out in the early 2000s. American publishers then didn’t know what to make of her stories, many of which blend African folklore with science fiction, fantasy and magical realism, and repeatedly rejected them as confusing or unrelatable. Once her books found a home, however, they proved irresistible to readers. Her nearly two dozen works of fiction have earned Okorafor a slew of honors — four Hugos, a Nebula, a World Fantasy Award. And a new generation of American storytellers who explicitly use their African heritage, history and mythology to inspire their work have followed in her wake, including Tomi Adeyemi, Ayana Gray, Jordan Ifueko and Namina Forna.</p>
			<p>Okorafor, who lives in Phoenix, Ariz., has long viewed herself as a bridge between two cultures. She was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Nigerian parents whose mindset was: “We’re American. But we’ll always be Nigerian; we’ll always want that connection,” Okorafor said. “My mom kept her accent on purpose.”</p>
			<p>In her writing, Okorafor draws on West African myths and figures, like the water spirit Mami Wata. The Kenyan artist Wangechi Mutu evoked the siren figure in her 2017 bronze sculpture “Water Woman.”</p>
			<p>A cast bronze sculpture of a topless figure with a mermaid tail. The sculpture is outside on a sunny day, surrounded by grass and trees, and facing away from the camera toward a body of water.</p>
			<p>That connection is the heartbeat of Okorafor’s work, from her sci-fi fantasy novel “Who Fears Death,” set in a post-apocalyptic fictional African nation, to a three-issue arc of Marvel Comics’s Black Panther series. She does extensive research for each of her books and anchors her fantastical stories in traditional West African myths: For example, her “Akata” trilogy, about a Nigerian American albino girl with magical powers, features the mermaid-like Mami Wata, the spider deity Udide, the trickster spirit Ekwensu and Nsibidi symbols, all of which are drawn from Nigerian folklore.</p>
			<p>Diasporic folktales also run through Okorafor’s work. She started writing at 19, when she was temporarily paralyzed after a surgery to treat scoliosis went wrong. Her first short story, written from her hospital bed, was about a flying woman — a character that allowed her to transcend her own physical limitations. Years later, Okorafor came across the folktale of the Flying Africans, enslaved people in the United States who could fly and used their powers to return to Africa; the myth helped inspire her first published novel, “Zahrah the Windseeker,” about a 13-year-old girl who learns to fly, which won the Wole Soyinka Prize for Literature in Africa in 2008.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>As more publishers embrace the artistic and commercial value of African stories, what was once a lonely perch for Okorafor and writers like her has become a beautifully crowded one. Okorafor is excited at the prospect of more literature that speaks to diasporic themes, and of more storytelling directly from Africa. “I’m separate from the continent, but I’m very much connected,” she said. “Some of my connections may be a little spotty, weird and indirect. But that back and forth is strong.”</p>

				<h2>As filmmakers, the Ebo twin sisters draw inspiration from their American Southern and Nigerian heritage, with a little Japanese anime and “hood classic” cinema thrown in.</h2>
				<p><i>This story has been reproduced as part of coursework for the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. It was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/16/world/africa/african-artists-ruth-carter-mr-eazi.html">originally published on The New York Times</a>.</i></p>

			<p>For their first feature film, Adamma and Adanne Ebo took on the Black church — specifically, the Southern Black church. With its vibrant cultural and spiritual expressions, the twin sisters found surprising ties to Nigeria, their father’s homeland.</p>
			<p>“They say write what you know,” Adamma, who wrote and directed “Honk For Jesus. Save Your Soul,” said in a recent interview; her twin, Adanne, produced the film.</p>
			<p>The movie stars Sterling K. Brown as the fallen pastor of an Atlanta megachurch, and Regina Hall as his pious yet powerful wife. Both actors also signed on as producers, along with the Oscar-award winning actor Daniel Kaluuya; Jordan Peele, the Oscar-winning writer and director of “Get Out,” was an executive producer. Among laugh-out-loud moments, the satirical mockumentary delivers an empathetic reflection on church community, and the invisible labor of women that sustains it.</p>
			<p>The Ebo sisters’ debut feature film, “Honk For Jesus. Save Your Soul,” is a satirical look at megachurches, which are influential across the American South and in Nigeria.</p>
			<p>“There’s a lot of dissonance between the two cultures, but then there’s also a lot of overlap,” said Adamma, of Nigeria and the American South. “Church is one of them,” Adanne added.</p>
			<p>The children of an American mother and Nigerian father, the sisters describe their upbringing in Atlanta as culturally both Southern Black American – they both played alto sax in a marching band – and Nigerian.</p>
			<p>Adamma and Adanne fell in love with cinema through movies like the anime classic “Kiki’s Delivery Service,” as well as films they call “hood classics,” including “Baby Boy,” directed by John Singleton, and the crime saga “Juice” (“criminally underrated”). Like their mother, they attended a historically Black university in the South (their mom is an alumna of Fisk University in Nashville, and the twins went to Spelman College). They haven’t traveled to Nigeria, and do not speak their father’s native language, Igbo. And yet, the sounds and scents of the home they were raised in were decidedly Nigerian.</p>
			<p>The writer and director Adamma Ebo counts “Kiki's Delivery Service” as one of her favorite films and returns to it often. She loves how the Japanese film director Hayao Miyazaki captures moments of stillness between tension and chaos.</p>
			<p>“Growing up, we were definitely the African kids,” Adamma said, “but definitely not African enough for our Nigerian folks.”</p>
			<p>In 2022, the sisters signed a multi-year development deal with Disney Television Studios. They are currently working on an animated superhero series and have formed their own production company. Its name, Ejime, means “twin” in Igbo.</p>

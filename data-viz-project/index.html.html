    <h1>American Lynching Coverage in the Press</h1>
    <h2>The Responsibility of Journalists in Violence Against African Americans from 1789-1963</h2>
    <h3>By Hailey Closson</h3>
    <p> The Howard Center for Investigative Journalism and Capital News Service are investigating lynching coverage in American papers from 1789-1963. This is an ongoing project. Capital News Service examined the Library of Congress Chronicling America newspaper database and found 60,000 articles including lynching coverage. These are graphs of representing over 2,500 articles that have been categorized by mob nature. In Rob Well's JOUR389L class, students are studying the identification of lynch mobs by American papers, spikes in lynching coverage over decades, the representation of African American lynching victims, the normalization of extralegal justice, and journalist's contribution to the erasure of African American history. </p>
